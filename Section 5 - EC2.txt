      Section 5 - EC2
    - Virtual Machines in the cloud.
    - Provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud.
    - Instantly provision resources, no need for months of ordering systems etc.
    - Only pay for capacity you use.
    - Options;
      - On demand;
        - Pay fixed rate by the hour with no commitment or contract.
        - Applications with short-term unpredictable workloads that cannot be interrupted.
        - Applications being deployed or tested for the first time.
      - Reserved
        - Discount on hourly charge but requires 1 or 3 year contract.
        - Applications with predictable usage.
        - Upfront payment to reduce cost further.
      - Spot
        - Bid what you want for capacity, greater savings if you require off peak capacity.
        - Applications that have flexible start and end times.
        - Applications that need low compute prices.
        - If AWS terminate your hour you get it free, if you cancel you pay.
      - Dedicated hosts
        - Physical EC2 server dedicated for your use, reduce costs as you can use existing server-bound software licenses.
        - Used for regulatory requirements that may not allow multi-tenant virtualisation.
        - Used for licensing that doesn't support multi-tenancy.

      EBS
    - Create storage volumes and attach them to EC2 instances.
    - You can create files systems, run databases or run any other block device operations on these devices.
    - Automatically replicated.
    - Cannot mount 1 EBS to multiple EC2 instances, instead use EFS.
    - 4 types;
      - General Purpose (SSD) - balance both price and performance. <= 10,000 IOPS
      - Provisioned IOPS (SSD) - for I/O intensive applications, large databases. > 10,000 IOPS
      - Throughput Optimized (HDD) - for big data, warehousing, log processing etc.
      - Cold (HDD) - Lowest cost, used for infrequently accessed workloads.
      - Magnetic Standard - Lowest cost of all bootable EBS, for infrequently accessed data.
