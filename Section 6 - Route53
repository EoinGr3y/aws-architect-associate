    Section 6 - Route53

    DNS
  - Converts human friendly domain names to an ip address.
  - Domain name is a string of characters separated by dots (e.g. ".co.uk")
  - Domain names are controlled by the IANA.
  - Domain registrars are an authority that can assign domain names directly under one or more top-level domains.

    SOA Records store information about;
  - Name of server that supplied data for the zone.
  - Administrator of the zone.
  - Current version of the data file.
  - Number of seconds a secondary name server should wait to check for updates.
  - Number of seconds a secondary name server should wait to retry a failed zone transfer.
  - Maximum number of seconds a secondary server can use data before it should be refreshed or expire.
  - Default number of seconds for the time-to-live file on resource records.

    NS records
  - Used by top level domain servers to direct traffic to the Content DNS server.

    TTL
  - Length of time a DNS record is cached. (Time to Live)

    CNAMES
  - Canonical name, can be used to resolve one domain name to another.

    Alias Record
  - Used to map resource record sets in your hosted zone to ELB, S3 buckets etc.
  - Route53 automatically detects changes in the record sets.

    Route53 Routing Policies;
    Simple;
  - Default on creation, commonly used when you have a single resource for your domain, e.g. web server to serve content.

    Weighted;
  - Define a wight value to determine routing balance between multiple resources.
  - Useful for A/B testing.

    Latency;
  - Route traffic based on the lowest latency for your end user.

    Failover;
  - Allows you to create an active/passive setup using healthchecks.

    Geolocation;
  - Route traffic based on geographic location of users.
  - Used for scenarios where language/currency is important.

    Exam tips
  - ELBs don't have pre-defined ip4 addresses, they're resolved using a DNS name.
  - Understand difference between Alias Record and CNAME.
  - Given the choice always use Alias record over a CNAME.
  - Different routing policies and use cases.
