    Section 11 - The Well Architected Framework

    Best Practices Whitepaper
    Benefits of the Cloud
  - Zero upfront infrastructure, more efficient resource usage, reduced time to market, scriptable infrastructure, auto scaling, disaster recovery.

  - Design for failure, be a pessimist.
  - Decouple your components. (SQS)
  - Implement elasticity;
    - Proactive cyclic scaling - periodic scaling that occurs at a fixed regular interval.
    - Proactive event scaling - expecting a big surge. (e.g. black friday)
    - Auto scaling based on demand - use a monitoring service and scale up or down based on metrics.
