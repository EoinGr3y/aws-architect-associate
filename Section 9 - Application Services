  - Retention period of up to 1 year.
  - Worker - program that interacts with SWF to get tasks, process them and return results.
  - Decider - program that controls the coordination of tasks, their ordering and scheduling according to the application logic.
  - Tasks in SWF are only assigned once and never duplicated.
  - SWF is a task-orientated API, while SQS is a message-orientated API.
    SNS
  - Web service for sending notifications from the cloud, can publish messages from an application and deliver them to subscribers or other applications.

    Kinesis
  - Platform on AWS that you can send streaming data to.
  - Easy to load and analyze streaming data and can build custom applications for your business need.

  - Streams consist of shards, shards give up to 5 transactions/sec for reads, max read rate of 2MB/sec and 1000 records/sec for writes, max write rate of 1MB/sec.
  - Firehose - data producers send data to firehose, no shards or consumers required.
  - Analytics - run sql queries on data when it's in firehose or streams.
