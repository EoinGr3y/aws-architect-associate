      Section 4 - S3
    - Simple Storage Service, secure, scalable object storage.
    - Place to store files, used by creator of dropbox.
    - File size <= 5TB.
    - Files are stored in buckets. (folders)
    - Names of buckets must be unique globally.
    - Read and write consistency for PUTS of new objects.
    - Eventual consistencyfor PUTS and DELETES.

      Storage Tiers
    - S3 - standard.
    - IA (infrequently accessed) - data accessed less frequently but required rapid access. Lower fee than S3 but has retrieval fee.
    - Reduced Redundancy Storage - lower durability and lower fees than S3, used for data that can be generated again if lost.
    - Glacier - Takes 3 to 5 hours to restore data, cheaper storage.

      S3 Object Structure
    - Key
    - Value
    - VersionID
    - Metadata
    - Sub resources: (access control lists, torrent))

      Versioning
    - Stores all versions of an object (including deletes).
    - Cannot be disabled once enabled.
    - MFA delete can provide additional layer of security.

      Replication
    - Versioning must be enabled on both buckets.
    - Existing files are not replicated automatically, only newly created.
    - Deleting individual versions will not be replicated.

      Lifecycle management
    - Automatically manage data transition from storage tiers after creation date.

      CloudFront
    - CDN - network of servers that deliver web content to a user based on geo location.
    - origin - origin of all files the CDN will distribute.
    - Distribution - name given to the CDN which consists of a collection of CDNs.
    - Edge locations are for write as well as read.

      Encryption
    - In Transit;
      - SSL/TLS.
    - At Rest;
      - Server side encryption;
        - S3 Managed Keys SSE-S3
        - AWS Key Management Service SSE-KMS
        - Server side encryption with customer provided keys SSE-C
      - Client side encryption
