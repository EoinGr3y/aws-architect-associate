      Section 4 - S3
    - Simple Storage Service, secure, scalable object based storage.
    - Place to store files, used by creator of dropbox.
    - File size <= 5TB.
    - Files are stored in buckets. (folders)
    - Names of buckets must be unique globally.
    - Read and write consistency for PUTS of new objects. (can immediately read new objects)
    - Eventual consistency for PUTS and DELETES. (takes time to delete/update)

      Storage Tiers
    - S3 - standard.
    - IA (infrequently accessed) - data accessed less frequently but required rapid access. Lower fee than S3 but has retrieval fee.
    - Reduced Redundancy Storage - lower durability and lower fees than S3, used for data that can be generated again if lost.
    - Glacier - Takes 3 to 5 hours to restore data, cheaper storage.

      S3 Object Structure
    - Key
    - Value
    - VersionID
    - Metadata
    - Sub resources: (access control lists, torrent))

      Versioning
    - Stores all versions of an object (even if deleted).
    - Cannot be disabled once enabled, only suspended.
    - MFA delete can provide additional layer of security.

      Replication
    - Versioning must be enabled on both buckets.
    - Existing files are not replicated automatically, only newly created.
    - Deleting individual versions will not be replicated.

      Lifecycle management
    - Automatically manage data transition from storage tiers using creation date.

      CloudFront
    - CDN - network of servers that deliver web content to a user based on geo location.
    - origin - origin of all files the CDN will distribute.
    - Distribution - name given to the CDN which consists of a collection of CDNs.
    - Edge locations are for write as well as read.
    - You can clear cached objects on edge locations.

      Security
    - Newly created buckets are private.
    - Access control can be configured using bucket policies or access control lists.
    - Buckets can be configured to create access logs to log all requests.

      Encryption
    - In Transit;
      - SSL/TLS.
    - At Rest;
      - Server side encryption;
        - S3 Managed Keys SSE-S3
        - AWS Key Management Service SSE-KMS
        - Server side encryption with customer provided keys SSE-C
      - Client side encryption

      Storage Gateway
    - Connects on premise software appliance with cloud based storage.
    - Downloaded as a VM image that you install on a host in your datacenter.
    - Four different types;
      - File Gateway. (NFS - object based);
        - Flat files stored in your S3 buckets and accessed through a NFS mount point.
        - Once objects area transferred to S3 they can be managed as S3 objects.
      - Volume Gateway (iSCSI - block based);
        - Data written to disk volumes in blocks.
        - Data can be asynchronously backed up.
        - Stored Volumes;
          - Store entire copy of your data locally, data is backed up to AWS S3.
        - Cached Volumes;
          - Only keeping most recently written data locally, eveything else stored on S3.
      - Tape Gateway;
        - Archive data stored in AWS cloud as backups in S3 and can be configured to archive in Glacier.

      Snowball
    - Import Export was legacy process, send disks into AWS for importing.
    - 3 types;
      - Snowball
        - Petabyte scale data transport solution.
        - Multiple layers of security.
      - Snowball edge
        - 100TB device.
        - Also includes compute capabilities, can run lambda functions.
      - Snowmobile
        - Sea container on a truck.
        - Petabyte or larger size, for extremely large data transfers.

      Transfer Acceleration
    - Utilizes the CloudFront Edge Network to accelerate uploads to S3.

      Static Websites
    - Serverless, cheap and scales automatically.

      Other
    - Http 200 code for successful write.
    - Upload to s3 faster with multipart upload enabled.
    - Read S3 FAQ before exam.
