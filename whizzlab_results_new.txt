  - Kinesis only used for real-time data processing/analytics.
  - Aurora can grow up to 64TB, has replica lag < 100ms and up to 15 replicas.
  - Minimum volume of throughput optimised HDD is 500GB.
  - S3 infrequent access is more cost effective than glacier with expedited retrievals.
  - Use autoscaling group cool down timers to stabilise scaling.
  - Use S3 prefixes to improve throughput.
  - Elasticache is ideal for storing session data.
  - Using a sequential prefix for S3 upload increases the likelihood of writing to the same partition, slowing performance.
  - VPC flow logs captures IP traffic going to and from your VPC.
  - Use throughput optimised for batch processing activities.
  - NAT Gateway must be hosted in a public subnet.
  - Lambda can be cost effective, as you only pay when it runs, no infrastructure costs.
  - VPC endpoint allows you to privately connect a VPC to amazon resources.
  - Use static websites for disaster recovery.
  - Use multivalue answer for random routing with route53.

    CSAA Practice Test 2 (02/09/18 10:48PM) - 80%
  - Use DynamoDB streams to trigger events based on data edits.
  - Use individual NAT gateways in each availability zone to improve availability.
  - VM Import tools allows importing of VMs to AWS.
  - You can delete unnecessary Redshift snapshots to save money.
  - Gateway cached volumes can compliment existing customer storage space.

    CSAA Practice Test 3 (03/09/18 9:54PM) - 74%
  - Not all RDS instance types support encryption.
  - SQS queues eliminate the possibility of data loss.
  - Use read replicas for RDS disaster recovery.
  - Use VPNs to connect on-premise to AWS over the internet.
  - Use Cloudwatch metrics to monitor for errors.
  - Use signed URLs for S3 access control.
  - Use Opsworks to define stack-based models.
  - IAM policies can manage permission levels for users.
  - User data allows custom installations on EC2 instances.
  - Cannot use Multi AZ on a self managed db.
  - Public ip addresses change when an instance is stopped and started.

    CSAA Practice Test 4 (07/09/18 01:46) - 84%
  - Cloudtrail logs are encrypted by default.
  - Updates take time to take effect in S3, eventual consistency.
  - Use Gateway Stored volumes for on-premise backups.
  - SSE-S3 uses amazon-managed encryption keys.
  - Elastic beanstalk provides auto-scaling.
  - Weighted routing is best for blue-green deployments.
  - Multi AZ for RDS doesn't improve performance.

    CSAA Practice Test 5 (08/09/18 11:01) - 82%
  - Separate AWS accounts can be used to restrict resource deletion.
  - Elasticache can improve gaming performance.
  - DynamoDB stream is a flow of information about changes to items in a table.
  - Flow logs monitor traffic in and out of instances.
  - Back up and restore is cheaper than pilot light.
  - EBS is automatically replicated in it's AZ.
  - Use cross-regions snapshots for redshift cluster disaster recovery.

    CSAA Practice Test 6 (14/09/18 1:23) - 84%
  - ECS doesn't require any infrastructure maintenance.
  - AWS Direct Connect doesn't encrypt traffic.
  - HSM gives complete control of encryption keys.
  - Alias names provide DNS functionality.

  - Service control policies define which service APIs can be accessed by IAM entities.

    CSAA Practice Test 7 (17/09/18 12:22) - 84%
  - NAT Gateways should be placed in multi AZs.
  - Autoscaling can be enabled for DynamoDB.
  - KMS is AWS managed keys.
  - Redshift clusters can use CRR.
  - ELBs can be in public subnet while EC2 instances are in private.
  - Cross account IAM role can grant Resource access to third parties.
